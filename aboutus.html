                    <p>Dubai which is a city and a capital of Emirates of Dubai is said to be one of the wealthiest among the 7 Emirates. The history of human settlement in the area now defined by the United Arab Emirates is rich and complex, and points to extensive trading links between the civilisations of the Indus Valley and Mesopotamia, but also as far afield as the Levant. Archaeological finds in the emirate of Dubai, particularly at Al-Ashoosh, Al Sufouh and the notably rich trove from Saruq Al Hadid[23] show settlement through the Ubaid and Hafit periods, the Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods and the three Iron Ages in the UAE. The area was known to the Sumerians as Magan, and was a source for metallic goods, notably copper and bronze.Dubai is also a city of skyscrapers, beaches and ports. It is also a crime free city where administration efficiency and openness’s to business is encouraged. Rulers in Dubai sought to increase the city’s limited seafronts therefore in the absence of natural offshores, giant man-made islands were constructed such as Palm Jumeirah which is in the shape of a palm tree. The city is a year-round hot climate and humidity is high in the summer months. It holds a population of about 3.38 million people. </p>
